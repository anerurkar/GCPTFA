IAM (identity and access management)

Permission 
(start a virtual machine ) (compute.instance.start)
(stop a  virtual machine ) (compute.instance.stop)
(create a storage bucket ) (cloud.storage.create)
(list the virtual machines ) (respective permission for listing the vms)


permissions at a level is union of all permissions givent to its parent + permission givent at its own level

High level steps for Lab
1)given two users 
username 1 (owner role) 
username 2 (viewer role)

2)From username 1 -> we will create a bucket in cloud storage
upload files in the bucket that we created

3)from username 2-> we will be able to only view the resources
(not able to do any kind of edit operation)

4)Remove username 2 from the project  (username 2 shall not able to view the bucket contents)

5)Give a storage object viewer permissions to username 2
list the contents of the storage buckets

6)create a service account ,we will assign required premssions to service to talk to cloud storage
