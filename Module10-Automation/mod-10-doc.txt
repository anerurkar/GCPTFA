banking project
1)Application code is running in VMS (instance template,instance groups,load balancers)

2)custom network ,subnetworks,firewalls as per the project requirement
3)IAM policy for permissions related,custom roles ,created service accounts
4)cloud sql 
5)big query 
6)pub/sub 
7)CI/CD pipeline
8)cloud storage

console ui  (web)
cli (gcloud)
API (create your resources)
Error prune

iaac tools
we need to have a file ,that defines the structure of the resources


Terraform (.tf)  
init (initilising the terraform files)
plan (blueprint of changes going to happen in console)
apply (doing actual changes in the environment)
clean everything from your project (terraform destroy)


High level steps for our lab
1)create a service account and give editor role to the service account
2)download the key associated with the service account,put service account in your terraform lab folder and give the respective path in main.tf file
3)terraform init
4)put definition of custom network and subnetwork in main.tf file and then run following commands
terraform plan
terraform apply
5)verfiy that custom network is created or not
6)change the mtu paramter of vpc network
7)terraform plan
8)terraform apply
9)verify that mtu is changed in vpc
10)put the terraform code for creation of virtual machine in .tf file
terrafrom plan
terraform apply
verify that vm is created 
11)add script for firewall creation in main.tf file
12)put code for new virtual machine creation 
terraform plan
terraform apply

13)terraform destroy
4)


Multiple files
provider.tf  -> about the provider
network.tf   -> information related to netowrk resources
compute.tf   -> information related to compute engine
database.tf  -> information related to databases
cloudstorage.tf -> information related to cloud storage 

terraform plan

For deployment manager
first create your yaml file (resource definition file)
replace [MY_PROJECT] with your actual project id
gcloud deployment-manager deployments create my-first-deployment --config vm_creation.yaml  

//it will create the respective resources in your gcp console

To clean up your resources from deployment manager
gcloud deployment-manager deployments delete my-first-deployment
